description: "Horrid undead, manananggals walk among the living by day and prey upon them at night. These creatures delight in spreading fear and distrust. Manananggals pass themselves off as normal people, usually posing as mad old women, midwives, hedge witches, or mystics. This allows the undead creatures to select their prey from within the community. Once separated, a manananggal’s mobile torso has a 6-foot wingspan. Manananggal"
