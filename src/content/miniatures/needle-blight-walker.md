description: "Needle blights have vaguely bipedal forms, with gaunt, misshapen limbs. While they looked enough like a hunched humanoid to be mistaken for one in the shadows of a forest, when standing unnaturally still or lurching with their awkward gaits, these blights can't pass as either normal plants or woodland travelers.

Needle blights have vaguely bipedal forms, with gaunt, misshapen limbs. While they looked enough like a hunched humanoid to be mistaken for one in the shadows of a forest, when standing unnaturally still or lurching with their awkward gaits, these blights can't pass as either normal plants or woodland travelers.
