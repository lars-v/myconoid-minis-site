title: "Basilisk"
description: "Basilisks are large, eight-legged reptiles with adults typically weighing around 300 pounds and reaching 11 - 13ft. With the ability to poison or petrify their prey, travelers sometimes found objects that looked like pieces of remarkably lifelike stone carvings of wildlife. Seasoned explorers regard such relics as warnings, knowing the basilisk that created them is likely to be nearby. Basilisk"
