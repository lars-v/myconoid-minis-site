My minis take this into 3 dimensions with matte black priming and simple dry brushing to bring details out.\n\nNo fancy techniques, no endless highlighting. Just clean, bold details that pop on the gaming table and capture that authentic old-school vibe your campaign deserves.\n\n**You can keep it real and play with them as Crom intended, or slap on some speedpaint to make them fancy.**"
