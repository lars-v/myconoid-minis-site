title: "Roofolk Fighter"
description: "Roo-folk are a humanoid kangaroo. They were once docile and shy herbivores with powerful hind legs, large feet ending in clawed toes, a small head with large ears and a heavy, balancing tail. They now excel in the martial arts, so they could protect themselves from danger. Because of their muscular legs similar to a kangaroo, they are great leapers and use them in their natural kick attacks. Roo-folk"
