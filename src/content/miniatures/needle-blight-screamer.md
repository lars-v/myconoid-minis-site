While they looked enough like a hunched humanoid to be mistaken for one in the shadows of a forest, when standing unnaturally still or lurching with their awkward gaits, these blights can't pass as either normal plants or woodland travelers.

While they looked enough like a hunched humanoid to be mistaken for one in the shadows of a forest, when standing unnaturally still or lurching with their awkward gaits, these blights can't pass as either normal plants or woodland travelers.
