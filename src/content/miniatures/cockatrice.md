title: "Cockatrice"
description: "The cockatrice looks like a hideous hybrid of lizard, bird, and bat, and it’s infamous for its ability to turn flesh to stone. A cockatrice flies into the face of any threat, squawking and madly beating its wings as its head darts out to peck. The smallest scratch from a cockatrice's beak can spell doom as its victim slowly turns to stone from the injury. Cockatrice"
